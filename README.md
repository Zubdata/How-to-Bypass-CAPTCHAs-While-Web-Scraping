# How to Bypass CAPTCHAs While Web Scraping

This repository provides examples and code explanations for bypassing CAPTCHAs while web scraping. The code and demonstrations are meant to complement the content presented in a blog [post]() on Zubdata.

### Types of CAPTCHAs Covered:

1. ["I am not a robot" CAPTCHA](/Exampels/i_am_not_robot.py)
2. [Image-to-text CAPTCHA](/Exampels/iamge_captcha.py)
3. [Image classification CAPTCHA (ReCAPTCHA)](/Exampels/image_classification.py)


__Please note__ that the examples in this repository use dummy selectors, which should not be used in actual scraping scenarios. You should replace these selectors with appropriate ones for your specific web scraping tasks. I am just trying to explain the flow of code to bypass CAPTCHAs. The code demonstrates the process of bypassing CAPTCHAs using the [Capsolver](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/register?inviteCode=ea95bFDcyWyV) service.
